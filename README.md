## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Crypto-currencies have gained an incredible amount of attention recently and it has become a multi-trillion dollar market with most of the growth taking place in only the last 2 years.
Massive amounts of money flow through crypto-currency markets daily and coins are constantly competing to try and be the best.
All of this activity has resulted in a large amount of data and with the right processing, that data can be used to gain insight on the markets and their behaviours.
Over the last year I have been developing on ethereum and have learned a lot about crypto-currencies in a short period of time.
This project will be an oppourunity to look at the space in a different lens.
Rather than building infrastructure and creating the coins themselves, this will be a chance for me to take a step back and gain more of an understanding of the data behind it.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data I'm using is a collection of market prices from different markets on Binance.
At the time of writing this, Binance is the number 1 crypto-currency exchange in the world and has a daily trading volume of over \$10 billion.
The dataset covers the top 17 coins on Binance and includes the Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and tradecount with each row representing one trading day.
The dataset contains 17 CSV files with each csv in the dataset containing over 1000 entries and representing a traiding pair of the coin against USDT (A stablecoin that matches the US dollar).
Binance also offers markets that contain pairings without stablecoins such as ADA/ETH, BTC/ETH, and more. These pairings are not recorded in the dataset.
The Data is licensed under the [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and was created on 2021-01-13.

## Team Members

My name is Owen Murovec and I'm excited to solidify my knowledge in python and pandas throughout this project and gain more of an understanding of the markets behind cryptocurrencies.
